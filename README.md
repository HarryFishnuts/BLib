<h1> BLib is a simple graphics and window helper library </h1>
I have compiled together a bunch of useful functions and structures to make
2D rendering quicker and easier

<h2> BLib is built on openGL and GLFW </h2>
BLib is not the most efficient implementation of openGL or GLFW, but it
was never intended for large projects. For that, you are better off
making a rendering helper library yourself

<h2> BLib is written in pure C </h2>
Okay, I lied, there are C++ style comments, and not everything I do is
in classic C convention, but I think that clarity is important above all
else, and C++ just doesn't offer that kind of thing. It's also why you
see me comment so much

<h2> Important: </h2>
BLib is not in a functional state right now, i'd recommend using GLFW
for your window handling and something like SDL or SFML for your
graphics.

I'll be sure to update this readme once BLib is in a useable state

Thanks,
